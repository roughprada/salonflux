Hello,

This is a Mobile friendly responsive theme designed to work with mobile platforms as well as desktop browsers. It uses the Zurb Foundation framework from http://foundation.zurb.com
Use this theme with the responsive exhibition format (exhibit.responsive.php)

You can see the theme in action at http://vcrit.com/demo

Ed Nacional created the theme this is based on for the purpose of helping Indexhibit users who may not have extensive knowledge of css. He has commented the original code to be easily altered and understood.
Hopefully it also serves to help people figure out what each element does. 

The Nacional theme was developed in collaboration with Mushon Zer-Aviv as part of his class 'Open Source Design' at Parsons The New School for Design.
